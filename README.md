An online game of rock paper scissors that I created using the python web framework flask. The user will select one of three options which are rock, paper and scissors. They will then submit the answer and the back end code will select one of the three at random. The game is best of five and once that limit is reached the user has the option to restart the game.

Skills Learned:-
- flask routing
- python classes
- python methods
- python random library
